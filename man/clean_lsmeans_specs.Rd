\title{Helper function to clean one-sided formulas for lsmeans}
\usage{
clean_lsmeans_specs(specs)
}
\arguments{
\item{specs}{the specs input to process}
}
\value{
a two-sided formula with the LHS being 'pairwise' if the input is a
  formula, otherwise return original input
}
\description{
The \code{lsmeans::lsmeans()} function broke a golden rule: they
  return a different class of data based on unrelated parameters. In this
  case, if the \code{specs} parameter is a one-sided formula it returns a
  \code{lsmobj} whereas if it's two-sided for a list, it returns a
  \code{lsm.list}. This makes it quite hard to work with reliably. To address
  this, this helper function cleans the inputs before handing them off to
  \code{specs} to make a one sided formula (like \code{~ x + y}) into an
  acceptable two-sided formula (like \code{pairwise ~ x + y}), allowing
  lsmeans to be used and always producing a single class of output.
